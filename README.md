## Building TexWriter

TexWriter is designed for a Visual Studio 2019 development environment, using C++ and OpenGL.

To get a clean build of the application, we must first make a `--recursive` clone of this repository:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pacojq/TexWriter
```

Once the source is cloned, the Visual Studio solution can be generated executing the `GenerateProjects.bat` command.
